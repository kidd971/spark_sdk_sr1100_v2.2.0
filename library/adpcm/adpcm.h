 *      The following algorithm assumes original_sample is a 16-bit two’s complement variable.
 *      The variable new_sample is the resulting 4-bit ADPCM sample.
 *      The algorithm finds the difference between the original_sample and predicted_sample, the
 *      output of its predictor. This difference is then quantized down to a 4-bit new_sample, using
 *      step_size. The 4-bit new_sample has a sign-magnitude format. After new_sample has been
 *      calculated, it is uncompressed using the same quantization step_size to obtain a linear
 *      difference identical to that calculated by the decompressor. In order to correct
 *      for truncation errors in the quantization, ½ is effectively added to new_sample during
 *      the expansion. This difference is added to predicted_sample to form a prediction for the
 *      next sequential original_sample. newSample is used to adjust an index into the
 *      step_size_table. This index points to a new step_size in the step_size_table.
 *      predicted_sample, step_size, and index must be static variables between samples.
 *
