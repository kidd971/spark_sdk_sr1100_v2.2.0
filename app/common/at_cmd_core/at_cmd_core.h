/** @file  at_cmd_core.h
 *  @brief Common AT command core — shared across all applications.
 *
 *  Wraps at_module with the expansion UART backend and registers a set of
 *  built-in commands available in every application:
 *
 *    AT+VER         — firmware / SDK version string
 *    AT+STATUS      — system uptime in milliseconds
 *    AT+HELP        — list all registered AT commands
 *    AT+PING            — connectivity check, responds OK
 *    AT+MODULE_INFO?    — HW model, FW version, chip version, IC serial, device address
 *    AT+UWB_CONN_STATUS? — current UWB connection status (0=Standby,1=Pairing,2=Connected)
 *    AT+UWB_PAIR        — trigger UWB pairing (invokes registered pair callback)
 *
 *  Applications that need additional commands call at_server_register()
 *  directly after at_cmd_core_init().
 *
 *  Usage:
 *    1. Call at_cmd_core_init() once during application startup.
 *    2. Optionally register app-specific commands with at_server_register().
 *    3. Call at_cmd_core_process() every iteration of the main loop.
