 *  @brief TDMA sync module.
 *
 *  The TDMA module is responsible for keeping the sync between two radio. It is to ensure that the receiving radio
 *  catches the preamble and SFD that the transmitter is sending and locks on the signal.
 *
 *  ========== Notes about the wake-up timers of the radio ==========
 *
 *  The SR11X0 radio has wake-up timers. The first timer always counts on the xtal clock. The second timer always count
 *  on the currently active system clock. When the radio is in SHALLOW or DEEP sleep states, the clock is 32.768 kHz
 *  (xtal clock). For IDLE or ACTIVE power states, the clock is the currently configured PHY rate (chip rate). These may
 *  be 20.48 MHz, 27.30 MHz or 40.96 MHz. These clock speed are determined by the PLL.
 *

 *
 *  ========== Important registers ==========
 *
 *  REG16_SLPPERIOD_15_0(0x0C): First 2 bytes of the sleep period.
 *
 *      The sleep period is the amount of clock cycles that the wake-up timers must be equal to for the radio to wake
 *      up. The timers countinuously count and will simply rollover when they reach the "sleep period".
 *
 *      ref: SR1120 V3 datasheet, section 5.2.3 - Wake-Up Timers: SLPPERIOD description
 *
 *  REG16_SLPPERIOD_PWRUPDLAY(0x0D):
 *
 *      - SLPPERIOD_23_16: Last byte of the configurable sleep period.
 *      - PWRUPDLAY      : Extra time to wait after the chip wakes up before the transceiver listens or transmits over
 *                         the air. The time waited is equal to the register value times 8 chip clock cycles (PHY
 *                         rate/PLL clock). This is quite usefull if the radio is in a deep/shallow sleep and only has
 *                         a crystal clock precision to count. It can add a transceiver "power-up delay" that is
 *                         counted with the precision of the PLL since the radio is now awake.

 *                         section 5.2.4 - Transceiver Wake-Up Time and Timeout: PWRUPDLAY description
 *
 *  REG16_TIMELIMIT_BIASDELAY(0x0E):
 *
 *      - TIMEOUT: Cycle count for the radio's RX to timeout and indicate that an RX has failed and timed out, usually
 *                 through an IRQ. When the radio starts listening over the air, a timer begins and counts until it
 *                 has reaches this value.
 *
 *  REG16_TIMERCFG_SLEEPCFG(0x0F): Configure the sleep behavior.
 *
 *      - SLPRXEND: 1 - Put radio to sleep when RX ends
 *      - SLPTXEND: 1 - Put radio to sleep when TX ends
 *      - SYNWAKUP: X - Reset the wake-up timer when radio wakes up (This is not set explicitaly in the code, but the
 *                      default behavior of the radio is that it does reset)
 *                      ref: SR1120 V3 datasheet, section 5.2.5 - Wake-Up Timers: SYNWAKUP description
 *
 *  RXSFDTIME(0x13): Saves the count held in the wake-up timer right after the SFD is received. This is the value that
 *                   will allow to adjust the sync.
 *                   ref: SR1120 V3 datasheet, section 5.2.5 - Time Records: RXSFDTIME description
 *
 *  ========== Strategy for syncing ==========
 *
 *      In the TDMA sync module, a "target" RXSFDTIME is defined. On each time slot, the RXSFDTIME is read from the
 *      radios registers. If there is a difference (error), the sleep time is adjusted so that on the next timeslot,
 *      the difference between the target and the actual goes to 0.
 *
 *      Ex:
 *          - expected = 1000
 *          - actual = 1024 (this mean we woke up 24 cycles too early)
 *          - set SLPPERIOD = 1024 (we compensate on the next timeslot to wake up 24 cycles later)
 *
 *  ========== Timeslot diagram ==========
 *
 *      Now that we have a strategy, let's define what the "target" RXSFDTIME should theoretically be. To do that, the
 *      events happening during a timeslot must be analyzed. Let's use a simple timeslot of 1 ms.
 *
 *      Let's first consider what the TX looks like for the radio, since ultimately, it's the RX that must sync
 *      onto the TX.

 *
 *                                  Figure 1: A typical TX frame
 *
 *      To sync on the signal, the RX must catch the preamble and the SFD. It will then extend its listening period
 *      until the full payload is received. With this information, we can define an ideal RX frame. The RX frame should
 *      try to "surround" the preamble and SFD with a small error margin.
 *
 *      0 ms                                                                                   1ms

 *      |=================================-----------------------------------------------------|
 *
 *                             Figure 2: A typical RX frame next to a TX
 *
 *      The TDMA sync module represents this error margin as the "setup" time. In short, that whole sequence is the RX
 *      timeout.
 *
 *                      |<-setup-><----preamble----><----SFD----><-setup->|

 *
 *                            Figure 3: Definition of an RX window
 *
 *      In reality, the TDMA sync module tries to wake up TX and RX a bit delayed. This is because the TX will
 *      immediately start doing a CCA, preamble, SFD, payload and ack when it wakes up. The ideal scenario is that the
 *      TX wakes up a bit later (tx_delay) so that its preamble starts just after the setup time of the RX. Here are
 *      both TX and RX frames together.
 *
 *      The code will simply add or remove this delay when switching from RX to TX. Its counterpart will do the same,
 *      and all this will then cancel out.

 *                      Figure 4: Synced RX and TX frames with the aligned RX window definition
 *
 *      If the 2 radios have any drift at all in their PLLs, the two frames might become de-synced, as represented on
 *      figure 5, the RX will add this drift to the sleep period so that on the next timeslot, the
 *      expected RXSFDTIME is equal to the actual RXSFDTIME. This is a visual representation of the example given in
 *      the strategy explanation.

 *
 * ========== SHALLOW and DEEP sleep levels ===========
 *
 *      When the radio is requested to go into SHALLOW or DEEP sleep, the wake-up timer in the radio counts at 32.768
 *      kHz (xtal clock). This is considerably lower than a typical PHY rate of 20.48 MHz. The TDMA sync module will
 *      then calculate the nearest xtal clock cycle and add a power up delay so that the TX/RX begins at the proper
 *      time. The difference is represented in figure 6.
 *
 *      Note:
 *
 *      1. The radio wakes up on xtal clock falling edge.
 *      2. There is a race condition between the reset of the xtal counter and the counter increment on the rising
 *         edge. So if we reset the timer at the same time when it should increment, the behavior would be that we
 *         reset and count immediately to 1, which would create about a 30.5 us offset.
 *
 *      Here are the procedures to address these problems:
 *
 *      1. Subtract the 1/2 xtal cycle when calculating SLPPERIOD.
 *      2. If we are waking up close to a xtal rising edge, i.e. when xtal_cycle_offset = 1/2 xtal cycle, we sould wake
 *         up 1/2 xtal cycle earlier and use PWRUPDLAY to fill the remaining "sleep" time. This will allow to reset the
 *         xtal timer as far as possible from the increment of the xtal timer. This is shown in figure 7 and figure 8.

 *
 *                   Figure 6: Using PWRUPDLAY to compensate for xtal's timing precision compared to PLL clock
 *
 *      We see that when in IDLE the number of PLL cycles to put in SLPPERIOD is 13 (closest). If the radio was to be
 *      in SHALLOW sleep mode, the number of cycles to put in SLPPERIOD would be 4 and PWRUPDLAY would be 2 PLL cycle
 *      (closest).
 *
 *      We also notice that at any moment, the xtal offset must be kept into account to make sure that this half
 *      cycle's time is accounted for in our calculations. The xtal offset is 0 when the radio wakes up from SHALLOW
 *      or DEEP sleep by definition.
 *
 *      Let's see a problematic example when xtal offset is close to 1/2 xtal cycle.
