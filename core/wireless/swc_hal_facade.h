 *
 *  @brief Facades for low-level platform-specific features required by SPARK Wireless Core.
 *
 *  @note This header defines the interfaces for various hardware features used by the
 *  SPARK Wireless Core library. These facades abstract the underlying
 *  platform-specific implementations of features like SPI communication,
 *  IRQ handling, timer functions, and context switching mechanisms. The actual
 *  implementations are selected at compile time based on the target platform,
 *  allowing for flexibility and portability across different hardware.
 *
 *  The facade is designed to be a compile-time dependency only, with no
 *  support for runtime polymorphism. This ensures tight integration with the
 *  build system and minimal overhead.
